# Sample Technique Page

<br/>

All of this is unstyled right now and looks terrible. If you're viewing this page from a mobile device then it'll look even worse. 

<br/> There will be a **lot** more content here when the site fully launches.

<br/>

There would be a demonstration video at the top of each page:

<br/>

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ`

<br/>

Followed by common ways the technique is written in tabs:

<div class="tabImg">
  <img src="images/exampletab.jpg" />
</div>

**And of course the tabs will be affected by dark mode as well.**

(Note: There will be more than one image for most of these)

<br/>

...and then more text content explaining how the technique is done. 

<br/>

At the bottom of the page, there will be tabs for exercises you can do on your own time.
