### Notation

![Soundhole Strum]()

Since the soundhole strum is very rarely used outside of Eddie van der Meer's arrangements, there is no notation for this that is commonly agreed upon. It can be notated by a symbol directly above the sheet music that would be explained either next to the symbol or at the end of the sheet music.

### Explanation

The soundhole strum is a percussive technique used by Eddie van der Meer.

To perform a soundhole strum, do a strum and at the end of the strum, hit the back of your fingernail on the edge of the guitar's soundhole.
