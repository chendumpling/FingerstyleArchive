The palm slap is commonly notated as either multiple Xs covering the majority of the strings in a tab, or one giant X cover all the strings.

### Explanation

The palm slap is a percussive slap that also <span class="tt" data-tip="stop the strings from ringing">mutes</span> every string it comes in contact with. The slap sound comes from the guitar string coming in contact with the <span class="tt" data-tip="the metal strips on your fretboard">fret wire</span> itself.

Like any percussion technique, make sure to not put too much strength into the slap.
