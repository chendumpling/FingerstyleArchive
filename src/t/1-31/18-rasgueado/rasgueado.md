### Notation

![Rasgeuado]()

The rasgueado is commonly notated as 3 downward strums that are rhythmically close to each other and ridiculous to play using only downward strums. Sometimes, 'Rasg' is written above the notes. 

### Explanation

A rasgueado in fingerstyle is a simpler, shortened version of a flamenco rasgueado, and is used to strum multiple times in the same direction in quick succession to put emphasis on a strum. Instead of starting the rasgueado on a downbeat, in fingerstyle the rasgueado is commonly used to transition from one chord to another, landing it's last strum on the downbeat instead.

To play a rasgueado, prepare for a flick by pushing your index, middle, and ring finger into the base of your thumb (medical term is "Thenar Eminence") and flick outwards, one at a time, starting with your index first, then your middle, and finally your ring. 

The back of your fingernails should strum across the strings. Once you get used to this motion of flicking each of your fingers out, do it faster with less time in between the strums. Finally, put less emphasis on the middle and ring finger strums and more emphasis on the index by moving your hand downwards while performing the strums. 

#### A softer rasgueado

The rasgueado with the wind-up can sound too aggressive for some applications of the technique. Once you've learned the rasgueado with the wind-up, perform the same motion you got used to but this time, do it without first pushing your fingers into the base of your thumb. The rasgueado will sound more gentle and give you more control.
