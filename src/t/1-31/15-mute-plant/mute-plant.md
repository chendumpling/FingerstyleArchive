### Notation

<div class="tabImg">
  <img src="mute-plant.jpg" />
</div>

There is no special way to notate a mute. Look at the rhythmic portion of the sheet music (usually above the tab) for a <span class="tt" data-class="ttBigFont" data-tip="𝄻 𝄼 𝄽 𝄿 𝄾">rest symbol</span>. That is when you should mute the string(s). 

### Explanation

A mute (left hand) or plant (right hand) is a technique used to stop a string or multiple strings from ringing. 

#### Mute (left hand)

Place any left finger on the string without pressing down to the frets to stop it from ringing. 

#### Plant (right hand)

Place any right finger on the string in the position you use to prepare for a pick to stop it from ringing.
