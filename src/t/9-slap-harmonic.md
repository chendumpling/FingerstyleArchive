A slap harmonic is multiple tap harmonics played together by flicking multiple strings simultaneously with the index or middle finger - whichever is more comfortable.

Like a tap harmonic, your finger does not follow through with the strings to push it down to the <span class="tt" data-tip="the metal strips on your fretboard">fret wire</span> and after flicking them, and must immediately bounce back to not mute the strings as it returns to it's original position.

The slap harmonic is notated with multiple tap harmonics together, with T.H. commonly written above the harmonic. 

#### Common Harmonic Frets

For your reference. The parentheses () show the intervals of the harmonic note when compared to the open string or the fretted note.

- 1/2 = <12> (Octave)
- 1/3 = <7> <19> (Octave + 5th)
- 1/4 = <5> <24> (2 Octaves)
- 1/5 = <4> <9> <16> <28> (2 Octaves + 3rd)
- 1/6 = <3.2> <30> (2 Octaves + 5th)
