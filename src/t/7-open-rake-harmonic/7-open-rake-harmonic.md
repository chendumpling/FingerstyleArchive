The rake harmonic is used to play multiple artificial harmonics at once with a strum. 

To do a downwards rake harmonic strum, place your right index finger over the string to be strummed first just as you would in an artificial harmonic and rest your ring finger nail above the string. Then, while maintaining the shape of your hand, move your arm downwards with your ring finger strumming past each string from above.  

For an upwards strum, do the same thing but in the opposite direction, with your ring finger strumming past each string from below.

You can control how loud the rake harmonic is by relaxing and tensing your ring finger during the strum.

The rake harmonic is notated as several artificial harmonics and a strum arrow or squiggly line (usually used to notate a finger roll).
