The slap strum expands on the thumb slap technique by doing a quick strum at the same time. The strum is done by extending your index or middle finger quickly to brush across the strings as soon as the thumb slaps the string.

It should not be a slow strum, every note of the strum should almost sound like it's being played at the same time as the slap.

![Slap Strum]()

The slap strum is commonly notated with a few notes above an X, sometimes with a strum arrow. Strum arrow or not, the same technique can be used.

#### Targeting specific strings

The slap strum can also be used to strum one or two strings by not extending your strumming finger outward during the slap, but it is difficult to hit only the intended strings consistently without accidently hitting another string, even after years of practice. 

To consistently strum only the intended strings, you can <span class="tt" data-tip="stop from ringing">mute</span> the strings directly below and above the string(s) you are trying to strum. For a method that doesn't require muting strings, consider using a [Slap Pluck](slap-pluck).
