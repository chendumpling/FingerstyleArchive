The rake harmonic can be significantly more difficult than the open rake harmonic, since you need to properly strum every harmonic note in a chord shape. The difficulty gets harder the more complex the chord shape is, and the faster you perform it.

The finger positioning of the rake harmonic strum is the same as the open rake harmonic strum. Instead of simply strumming down, your hand also needs to move to the <span class="tt" data-tip="the metal strips on your fretboard">fret wire</span> the index needs to hover over to produce the individual harmonics.

Just like the open rake harmonic, the rake harmonic is notated as several artificial harmonics and a strum arrow or wave-like line (usually used to notate a finger roll). With the rake harmonic, you will see these harmonic notes form the shape of a chord.
